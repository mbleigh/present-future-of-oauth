The Present Future of OAuth
===========================

This talk, [given at RailsConf 2010](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14071), provides an overview of why an open authorization standard is good for the web. It included two very simple demos of OAuth 2.0 consumer and provider code, both of which are present here along with the slides.

Special thanks to Yahtzee for the (obvious) inspiration on the illustration style, and to everyone who came and saw the talk!
